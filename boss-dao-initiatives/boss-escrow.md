# ü§ù Boss Escrow

### The Problem

Asset trading can be a risky situation, and many things can go wrong.

Two people can agree to a trade, but disagree on who should be the first to send over their valuable CNFTs or tokens, causing the trade to fall apart. Even worse, someone could send their half of the trade to the other person, and the other person could refuse to send their half. Unfortunately, these situations occur frequently - we all know someone who has fallen victim to scammers and lost valuable CNFTs.&#x20;

Discord is home to countless CNFT communities, and many people advertise their CNFTs and set up trades through discord. Unfortunately, there is no 100% safe way to trade through discord. Secondary markets can be used, but they do not facilitate CNFT to CNFT trades, only ADA to CNFT sales.

### The Solution

As stated before, many people set up trades with other people using discord then. The CNFT community needs a convenient way to safely trade CNFTs and other assets through discord.

### Boss Escrow

Boss Escrow is a discord application currently in development by the Boss DAO development team. Boss Escrow will be available for any discord server to install, and will facilitate safe trading of Cardano assets between users, all using discord!

### How will Boss Escrow Work?

Example Scenario:

User1 and User2 have been discord messaging each other about a trade they want to make. They both agree that User1 will provide their BossCatRocketClub#1234 in exchange for User2's BossCatRockerClub#5678 and 500 ADA.

They move over to the Boss DAO discord server (or another server with Boss Escrow installed), and use bot commands to specify what they will be trading and who they will be trading it to. Boss Escrow confirms the trade with each participant, then constructs a transaction for each participant to send to the Boss Escrow service.

Once the Boss Escrow service receives both participant's transactions, it confirms they both sent the required amount. If they did, Boss Escrow sends each participant what they traded for. If not, Boss Escrow refunds each participant and tells them the trade failed, and why it failed.

Boss Escrow will charge a small fee for each successful trade, in order to pay for development cost and upkeep. Boss DAO members will not be required to pay the fee.

### $EXEC Usage

Escrow fees may be paid via $EXEC, if desired.
