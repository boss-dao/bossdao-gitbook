# ðŸš€ Boss Launchpad

### Concept

Boss Launchpad will be the premier CNFT launchpad for Cardano and support the creation of quality projects while eliminating the occurence of rug-pulls.

Boss Launchpad is a win-win for both project creators and CNFT enthusiasts. For project founders, Boss Launchpad represents a chance to receive support in the form of funding, minting assistance, community management, development reviews, and more. For CNFT enthusiasts, Boss Launchpad provides the ability chance to envision, build and support the kinds of CNFT projects they want to see created, without worrying about the risk of rug-pulls or any other shady business.

To have their CNFT project minted through our launchpad, project founders will need to:

* Hold at least 1 Boss DAO NFT
* Receive mint proceeds only in a pre-approved multi-sig wallet, with several of the keys entrusted to the Boss DAO Audit Team so stealing ADA from the mint is impossible
* Dox themselves privately to the Boss DAO Audit Team
* Make all scripts available for audit to the Boss DAO Audit Team
* Commit a small percentage (<5%, depending on launchpad assistance level) of mint proceeds to the Boss DAO Treasury
* Reserve mints for people who support their project through the launchpad

Boss DAO Members who want to mint a project from the launchpad must:

* Hold at least 1 Boss DAO NFT
* Pledge a certain amount of their $EXEC towards "launching" the project

### $EXEC Usage

$EXEC holders will be able to pledge their $EXEC in support of Boss Launchpad projects in return for a specific yield of the project, determined on a per-project basis.

### Boss DAO NFT Team

The first project to use the Boss DAO Launchpad will be launched by the Boss DAO NFT Team, which will consist of artists, developers, marketers, and administrators who the community votes in based on portfolio and experience. The Boss DAO NFT Team will be paid in $EXEC and the community will vote on what percent of mint proceeds get allocated to the team as a bonus. All other proceeds generated from Boss DAO NFT Team mints go straight into the Boss DAO Treasury.
