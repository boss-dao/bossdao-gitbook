# ðŸŒŠ Boss Stake Pool

### Stake Pools

Stake pools are the lifeblood of Cardano. They facilitate network decentralization and the processing of transactions.

Boss DAO will be launching the Boss Stake Pool to:

* Support the decentralization of Cardano
* Grow the Boss DAO treasury
* Reward Boss DAO members who delegate with Boss Stake Pool with $EXEC

The success of a stake pool is proportional to the amount of ADA delegated to it. To facilitate stake pool delegation, Boss Stake Pool will reward delegators to Boss Pool who hold at least 1 Boss DAO NFT and stake a minimum amount of ada.

Delegated funds are not controlled by the Boss Stake Pool - you are able to un-delegate your ADA at any time.
