### Refunds

**Refunds will be issued for valid transactions:**

1. Tx sent too late to receive a Boss DAO NFT
2. Tx with an incorrect amount of ADA (as a sender, please try to avoid this)

**Refunds will not be issued for invalid transactions**

1. Transactions associated with bot activity
2. Malicious transactions (those that include NFTs, etc)



### Anti-bot Measures

Anti-bot measures will be put in place to give everyone as fair of a chance as possible to mint Boss DAO NFTs. Transactions associated with bot activity will not be refunded and will instead be distributed to the DAO Treasury according to the Intitial Profit Distribution.
