# ðŸ“ˆ $EXEC

### Concept

$EXEC will be the utility token for the Boss DAO ecosystem. Tokens will be awarded for holding Boss DAO NFTs, staking with the Boss Stake Pool and most generously allocated to those who engage regularly in governance by voting and submitting proposals.

$EXEC will support the following Boss DAO initiatives:

[boss-escrow.md](../boss-dao-initiatives/boss-escrow.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../boss-dao-initiatives/boss-stake-pool.md" %}
[boss-stake-pool.md](../boss-dao-initiatives/boss-stake-pool.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../boss-dao-initiatives/boss-swap.md" %}
[boss-swap.md](../boss-dao-initiatives/boss-swap.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../boss-dao-initiatives/boss-launchpad.md" %}
[boss-launchpad.md](../boss-dao-initiatives/boss-launchpad.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Supply & Distribution

**Supply:** 10,000,000 tokens

**Distribution:**

* 10% Airdropped to Boss DAO NFT holders after final mint concludes
* 50% Airdropped over 3 years to Boss DAO members who regularly submit proposals and vote
* 20% Distributed as staking rewards over the course of 3 years to Boss DAO holders who delegate their Cardano wallets with Boss Stake Pool.
* 20% to Dev team to fund development and new hires necessary for Boss DAO Member services (Launchpad auditors, developers, administrators for the proposal process and governance**,** etc.)

### Governance Incentives

Other DAOs have struggled in the past to properly incentivize member participation, leading to one-sided votes, poor governance and failure of the organization.

$EXEC will facilitate DAO member participation in the governance process in several ways, keeping the Boss DAO ecosystem thriving and profitable for members:

* Boss DAO members who vote on official DAO votes will be awarded $EXEC.
* Boss DAO members who submit proposals that are successfully voted on will be awarded $EXEC
* Boss DAO members who offer valuable contribution to proposal discussion, the voting process, and general governance will be awarded $EXEC.

_$EXEC is still in early stages of development and content in this document is subject to change as development continues._
