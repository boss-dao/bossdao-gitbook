# ðŸ§  The Voting Process

### Concept

The DAO will utilize transparent, immutable, and on-chain voting for all of its formal votes.

This will occur via transaction-based voting. Boss DAO owners will vote by sending small transactions to specific wallets. These transactions will cost 3 ADA, and will be refunded to voters upon completion of the vote. The only cost voters will incur are network transaction fees.

### The Process

The voting process begin when a proposal is vetted and moves from Stage 1 - "Received" to "Stage 2 - Voting" at [https://github.com/boss-dao/proposals](https://github.com/boss-dao/proposals).&#x20;

The steps for voting are as follows:

1. Wallets are prepared to represent the options for each vote. For example, if the possible options for a vote are "Yes" and "No," two wallets will be used
2. DAO members send transactions of exactly three ADA to the address that represents the option they would like to vote for. Only one transaction needs to be sent, which will represent all of the sender's votes.
3. The voting software counts each DAO members vote based on the amount of Boss DAO NFTs the voter holds at the time of the vote
4. The time period for voting ends and ADA sent for votes is refunded to the senders
5. The results of the vote are published and action is taken according to the outcome

### FAQ

**How long will votes last?**

Most votes will last 24 hours.

**Do I need to send a transaction for each NFT I own?**

No, one transaction of 3 ADA counts for all of your votes. If your NFTs are separated across multiple wallets, you will need to submit transactions from each wallet or move all your NFTs to one wallet before voting.

**Do I need to send my Boss DAO NFT in the transaction to vote?**

No, do not do this.

**Can I take back my vote?**

No, all votes are final. Please confirm you are sending to the correct wallet and for the correct proposal before voting.

**How many votes are needed for majority?**

Greater than 50% of received votes constitutes a majority, calculated on a per-proposal basis.
