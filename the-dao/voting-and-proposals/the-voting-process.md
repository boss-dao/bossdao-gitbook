# ðŸ§  The Voting Process

### Concept

The DAO will utilize transparent, immutable, and on-chain voting for all of its formal votes.

This will occur via transaction-based voting. Boss DAO owners will vote by sending small transactions to specific wallets. These transactions will cost 3 ADA, and will be refunded to voters upon completion of the vote. The only cost voters will incur are network transaction fees.

### The Process

The voting process begin when a proposal is vetted and moves from Stage 1 - "Received" to "Stage 2 - Voting" at [https://github.com/boss-dao/proposals](https://github.com/boss-dao/proposals).&#x20;

The steps for voting are as follows:

1. Wallets are prepared to represent the options for each vote. For example, if the possible options for a vote are "Yes" and "No," two wallets will be used
2. DAO members send transactions of exactly three ADA to the address that represents the option they would like to vote for. Only one transaction needs to be sent, which will represent all of the sender's votes.
3. The voting software counts each DAO members vote based on the amount of Boss DAO NFTs the voter holds at the time of the vote
4. The time period for voting ends and ADA sent for votes is refunded to the senders
5. The results of the vote are published and action is taken according to the outcome
