# ðŸ¥´ Non-Contract Voting

The smart contract voting system is currently in development, but the DAO needs transparent, immutable, and on-chain voting immediately.

The solution to this problem is transaction-based voting. This sacrifices this convenience of browser-integrated smart contracts, but preserves the most crucial part of on-chain voting: transparency and immutability.

Boss DAO owners will vote by sending small transactions to specific wallets. These transactions will cost between 1 and 2 ADA, and will be refunded to voters once the vote is counted. The only cost voters will incur are network transaction fees.

After the designated voting period has elapsed, votes will be tallied based on whether or not the wallet that sent the transaction meets the designated criteria. Since the votes will take place on the blockchain, anyone will be able to audit and verify the result of each and every vote.
