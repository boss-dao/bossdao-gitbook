# ðŸ“„ Voting & Proposals

All votes will be held on-chain, making the results of each vote transparent and immutable. Voting will be held on the Boss DAO website (bossdao.io) via smart contracts once development finishes. Only Boss DAO holders with browser-integrated cardano wallets (Nami, CCVault, Flint, etc) will be able to participate**.**

**What can be voted on?**

* All topics regarding the assets purchased, sold, and held by the Boss DAO, whether it be an NFT, ADA, or other native asset(s), shall be voted upon by the DAO.
* Treasury Usage
* Distribution of profit from CNFTs in the form of ADA to Boss DAO holders
* Purchase of non-BCRC projects. While BCRC has been extremely successful, there are many other projects with potential out there. The nature of the Boss DAO will not be limited to acquiring BCRC assets, but rather bolstering the value of the Boss DAO treasury and Boss Planet Development.

**What can't be voted on?**

* Adding more Boss DAO Membership NFTs to circulation
* Burning NFTs in the DAO Treasury
* ADA handouts from treasury funds
* Conversion of ADA to non-cryptocurrency assets (USD, EUR, etc)
* Boss DAO Development Team's status within the DAO
* Additional Boss DAO related NFT mints - This is something that would need to be agreed on by both the DAO and the development team, since it would require time, effort and financial contribution from the team. Development on additional projects would only begin once both groups agree. Once this happens, the community can vote on the style, direction and purpose of the project.

**When will votes occur?**

In general, voting may occur at any time based on DAO decision.

After the initial treasury deposit has been spent on BossCats and voted CNFTs there will be a vesting period where no further actions will take place for the remainder of the quarter. Votes on whether to buy, sell or hold CNFTs will take place quarterly thereafter.

**How can I propose a topic to be voted on?**
