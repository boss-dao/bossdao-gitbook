# ðŸ“£ Proposals

Proposals may be submitted via the Boss DAO discord. The proposals channel will initially be open to all discord members, but will soon be open only to Boss DAO NFT owners.

All proposals **must** follow the proposal template at [https://github.com/boss-dao/proposals](https://github.com/boss-dao/proposals).

All proposals **must** be submitted as markdown (.md) files. Proposals may be uploaded to the discord proposals channel as .md files or as links to GitHub content.

[https://hackmd.io/](https://hackmd.io) and [https://stackedit.io/app#](https://stackedit.io/app#) are fully-featured browser-based markdown editors that can be used to edit the template proposal. Those familiar with GitHub can also use GitHub's built-in markdown editor.

Once your proposal is submitted, it will be published to the Boss DAO GitHub and publicly accessible.

Your proposal will then be vetted by the Boss DAO community on discord. If general consensus is that a vote should be held, the Boss DAO development team will organize and begin the vote.



**Why Markdown (.md) files only?**

Other file formats such as PDF (.pdf) and Word (.docx) are **regularly discovered to be exploitable.** These proposals will be read by many people with cryptocurrency wallets. **The Boss DAO development team does not want to take the risk of a malicious actor using the proposal process as an attack vector against the DAO or DAO members.** Markdown files are much safer by comparison, and still facilitate the proposal process well.

If you are unfamiliar with markdown, there are many free resources online. The development team has tried to make the proposal template as easy as possible to modify. We apologize for the inconvenience markdown may cause you at first - **security often comes at the sacrifice of convenience.**
