# üèó Team

The team is composed of three CNFT enthusiasts and passionate entrepreneurs. After being involved with the BCRC project since its earliest days, the team has decided to give back to the community by creating a new kind of BCRC project: a DAO.

## Professordumdum

ProfessorDumdum is a project co-founder and the lead marketer. A day one BCRC believer, he is now endeavoring to create the Boss DAO and enhance the CNFT ecosystem.

A full-time NFT degenerate, Dumdum spends nearly every waking minute buying, researching, and talking about "Useless JPGs". His father disapproves. His mother is very proud, as it pays her rent. Dumdum is also the creator of cnft.guide, a website dedicated to enriching and connecting the CNFT community. Check it out!

## Sdub

Sdub is a co-founder and leads the engineering side of the project. He is responsible for developing the code which facilitates DAO governance, including smart contracts.

Sdub currently works as a software engineer. He's loved video games since he was young and enjoys tinkering with game development (Unity) in his free time. He's been interested in blockchain technology for years, but the launch of Cardano Plutus smart contracts in 2021 is when he finally decided to enter the development space.

## Xyzzy

Xyzzy is a project co-founder and community manager. He is one of the primary minds behind DAO feature development.

A passionate innovator, Xyzzy is an early adopter of blockchain technology and has had ambitions of starting his own projects for several years.
