# ‚ùì What is a Dao?

Businesses and governments rely on hierarchical power structures, centralizing power to a board of executives or a core group of Politicians who are supposedly making decisions for the well-being of the whole. Sadly, the original intent is invariably corrupted to the point representatives and executives act in the interest of their campaign contributors or largest shareholders.

Votes have always been easily corrupted, but even if the vote is fair and balanced, blind trust must then be placed in authority figures who are flawed and human. Blockchain technology has changed the need for a centralized decision maker and provided a cryptographically verifiable voting system. No more cheating. No single person on top.

DAOs are a solution to the old power structures - A Decentralized, Autonomous Organization run through cryptographic voting on the blockchain. Members of this organization vote equally on each action the DAO takes and no one is in charge. In turn, members profit from the organization equally.
