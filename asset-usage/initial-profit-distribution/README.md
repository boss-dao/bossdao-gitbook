# ðŸ’¸ Initial Profit Distribution

Profit from the initial BOSS DAO mint will be distributed between the DAO Treasury and development team.&#x20;

50% of the proceeds will be used to purchase Boss Cat Rocket Club NFTs for the Boss DAO treasury as proof of concept for the project, to show its efficacy towards stabilizing and expanding the BCRC ecosystem.&#x20;

25% will be deposited as ADA in the treasury, to be used according to formal votes held by the DAO.

25% will go to the development team to support their livelihood and make it possible for them to continue working on the Boss DAO.

Royalties will be implemented for secondary markets (JPG.store, CNFT.io) at 10% per transaction. 75% of royalties will go towards the DAO treasury, and 25% will go towards the development team. Ideally, the steep royalty percentage will discourage rampant secondary market sales (flipping) and encourage long-term ownership & DAO interaction.\

Additionally, 500 Boss DAO Membership tokens will be split among the team to be used as payment for further developers brought on board and to ensure the team has enough voting power to preserve the original vision of the Boss DAO.
