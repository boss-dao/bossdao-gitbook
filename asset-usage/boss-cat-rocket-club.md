The Boss Cat Rocket Club (BCRC) is the CNFT project that the Boss DAO centers around.  BCRC has been wildly successful, making it unaffordable for many of the 60,000+ online community members to benefit from the advantages and profits of holding a Boss Cat- a several thousand ADA expense. The Boss DAO aims to make BCRC accessible to everyone and in doing so facilitate sustainable, community-led development of the Boss Cat Rocket Club ecosystem via governance protocols.
